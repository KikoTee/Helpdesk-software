# Help Desk Ticketing System

## Description

This is a Help Desk ticketing system prototype developed to handle tickets from internal customers within an organization. The system allows staff members to submit tickets for assistance, which can then be responded to and managed by the IT department. Additionally, the system provides functionality to track ticket statistics and display ticket information.

## Features

- **Submit a Ticket**: Staff members can submit tickets by providing necessary information such as staff ID, name, contact email, and description of the issue. If the issue is a "Password Change" request, a new password is automatically generated.
  
- **Show All Tickets**: Provides a list of all submitted tickets along with their details.
  
- **Display Ticket Information**: Allows users to view detailed information about a specific ticket based on its ticket number.
  
- **Respond to a Ticket**: Enables the IT department to provide a response to a ticket.
  
- **Reopen a Ticket**: Allows reopening of a closed ticket by the IT department.
  
- **Display Ticket Statistics**: Provides statistics on the number of submitted, resolved, and open tickets.
